- 30-49: Poor team (weak skills, poor fit)
- Minimum score: 10/100

TEAM: {team_name}
Track: {chosen_track}
Team Size: {len(members)} members
Average Individual Score: {avg_individual_score:.1f}/100

{members_text}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. SKILL COMPLEMENTARITY: Do members have complementary technical skills?
2. TEAM SYNERGY: Do their motivations align? Will they work well together?
3. TRACK FIT: Are their combined skills suitable for the chosen track? Ntote: This is not a hard rule.

Consider:
- Skill gaps and overlaps
